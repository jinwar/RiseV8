\section{Data Acquisition and Method}

In this paper, we focus on the P-to-S converted phase to study the seismic discontinuities in the lithosphere. We apply the receiver function method \cite[e.g.][]{Langston_1979,ammon1991isolation} to extract the converted phases from the P-wave coda of teleseismic events. The receiver function method is a widely used approach, which enhances the shear-wave signal by deconvoluting the vertical component from the radial component of the teleseismic records. However, the deconvolution process is usually unstable due to the existence of noise. We select the iterative time-domain method \cite{ligorria1999iterative} to stabilize the deconvolution. The method iteratively removes the coherent signal of the vertical record from the radial component to construct a time series that matches the radial component after convolving with the vertical record. This method produces receiver functions with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from noisy data compared to the frequency-domain division methods \cite{ligorria1999iterative}. The fitting error between the predicted and observed radial records also provides a good quality estimation of the receiver functions.
