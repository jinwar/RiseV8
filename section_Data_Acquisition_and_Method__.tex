\section{Data Acquisition and Method}

In this paper, we focus on the P-to-S converted phase to study the seismic discontinuities in the lithosphere. We apply the receiver function method \cite[e.g.][]{Langston_1979,ammon1991isolation} to extract the converted phases from the P-wave coda of teleseismic events. The receiver function method is a widely used approach, which enhances the shear-wave signal by deconvoluting the vertical component from the radial component of the seismic records. However, the deconvolution process is usually unstable due to the existence of noise in the real data. We select the iterative time-domain method \cite{ligorria1999iterative} to stabilize the deconvolution. The method iteratively remove the coherent signal of the vertical record from the radial component to construct a time series that matches the radial component after convolving with the vertical record. This method provides higher quality receiver functions from noisy data compared to the frequency-domain division methods.
